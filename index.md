# ggadjustedforest

**ggadjustedforest** creates publication-quality forest plots and
effect-size tables that display *only* the unadjusted and adjusted
estimates for a user-specified exposure variable of interest — hiding
confounder coefficients by design, in accordance with causal inference
principles (the “Table 2 fallacy”, Westreich & Greenland 2013).

## Motivation

When the estimand of interest is the effect of a single exposure
variable, reporting confounder coefficients alongside it is misleading:
those coefficients are not identified under the causal model and depend
on the full causal structure. `ggadjustedforest` makes it easy to
present the exposure effect cleanly, before and after adjustment.

## Installation

``` r

# Install from local source (CRAN submission pending)
install.packages("path/to/ggadjustedforest", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

## Quick start

The examples below use `colon_s` from the `finalfit` package — 929 colon
cancer patients from the NCCTG trial. The research question is whether
having \>4 positive lymph nodes (`node4`) increases 5-year mortality
(`mort_5yr`), before and after adjusting for patient and tumour
characteristics.

``` r

library(ggadjustedforest)
library(finalfit)  # for colon_s

data(colon_s)
colon_s$died_5yr <- as.integer(colon_s$mort_5yr == "Died")

confounders <- c("age", "sex.factor", "extent.factor", "differ.factor", "surg.factor")

# Unadjusted vs fully adjusted — pipe-friendly
result <- colon_s |>
  gg_adjusted_forest(
    outcome    = "died_5yr",
    exposure   = "node4",
    covariates = confounders,
    model_type = "logistic",
    title      = "Effect of Lymph Node Involvement on 5-Year Mortality"
  )
result$plot
result$table          # tibble of numeric estimates
result$formatted_table  # tibble with "OR (lower–upper)" strings

# Cumulative adjustment — watch the estimate evolve as confounders are added
result_cum <- gg_adjusted_forest(
  data       = colon_s,
  outcome    = "died_5yr",
  exposure   = "node4",
  covariates = confounders,
  model_type = "logistic",
  cumulative = TRUE,
  cumulative_labels = c(
    "Unadjusted"                                                         = "Unadjusted",
    "+ age"                                                              = "+ Age",
    "+ age + sex.factor"                                                 = "+ Sex",
    "+ age + sex.factor + extent.factor"                                 = "+ Extent of spread",
    "+ age + sex.factor + extent.factor + differ.factor"                 = "+ Tumour differentiation",
    "+ age + sex.factor + extent.factor + differ.factor + surg.factor"   = "+ Time from surgery"
  ),
  title = "Cumulative Adjustment: Lymph Node Involvement on 5-Year Mortality"
)
result_cum$plot

# Multiple outcomes — stack with patchwork (already a dependency)
library(patchwork)
p1 <- gg_adjusted_forest(colon_s, "died_5yr", "node4", confounders,
                          model_type = "logistic", title = "5-Year Mortality",
                          show_table = FALSE)$plot
p2 <- gg_adjusted_forest(colon_s, "status",   "node4", confounders,
                          model_type = "logistic", title = "Death (all follow-up)",
                          show_table = FALSE)$plot
p1 / p2

# Cox proportional hazards
cox_result <- gg_adjusted_forest(
  data       = colon_s,
  outcome    = "status",
  exposure   = "node4",
  covariates = confounders,
  model_type = "coxph",
  time_var   = "time.years",
  event_var  = "status",
  title      = "Hazard of Death by Lymph Node Involvement"
)
cox_result$plot
```
